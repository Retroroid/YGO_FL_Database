# YGO_FL_Database
A set of python utilities for maintaining a database of the history of Forbidden/Limited Lists for the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.

Main files are banlist_util.py as the toolset to parse the webpage and add it to the database, and FL_List.db as the target database.
converter.py is a utility I made to parse the information from the excel document to the database file.
